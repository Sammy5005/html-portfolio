<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey there! I'm a beginner web developer with a growing passion for creating clean, functional, and user-friendly websites.<br>
   It’s my very first project, and every part of it—from the layout to the code—has been built with curiosity, dedication, and a strong desire to learn.
<br>I recently started exploring the core building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With each new concept I learn, I'm more excited about the endless possibilities this field offers

  This site is not just a showcase—it's a reflection of my learning process and a space where I’ll continue to add new projects and skills as I evolve as a developer.

  Thanks for stopping by and being part of the journey!</p>
